# Titanic Dataset Preprocessing

## Introduction

This project focuses on the preprocessing of the Titanic dataset, a classic dataset used for binary classification tasks. The goal is to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms by performing essential data cleaning and transformation steps.

### Objectives

1. **Understand the Dataset:** Explore and familiarize with the Titanic dataset.
2. **Handle Missing Values:** Identify and address missing values to ensure data completeness.
3. **Feature Scaling:** Normalize or standardize numerical features for consistent scaling.
4. **Encode Categorical Variables:** Convert categorical features into numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
5. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features to enhance the predictive power of the dataset.

### Dataset Description

The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including:

- **Survived:** Indicator of survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass:** Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name:** Name of the passenger
- **Sex:** Gender of the passenger
- **Age:** Age of the passenger
- **SibSp:** Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch:** Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket:** Ticket number
- **Fare:** Passenger fare
- **Cabin:** Cabin number
- **Embarked:** Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

### Steps to Follow

1. **Load and Explore the Data:** Load the dataset and perform initial exploration to understand its structure and content.
2. **Handle Missing Values:** Identify missing values and apply appropriate strategies to handle them.
3. **Feature Scaling:** Apply scaling techniques to normalize or standardize numerical features.
4. **Encode Categorical Variables:** Transform categorical features into numerical representations using encoding techniques.
5. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features that can improve the model's performance.

By the end of this project, the dataset will be clean and ready for machine learning model development. This notebook documents each step of the preprocessing workflow for a machine learning model dveelopment, providing clear explanations and code examples.
